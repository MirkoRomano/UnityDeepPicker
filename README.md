# ðŸ”Ž Unity Deep Picker (SceneView Finder)
A lightweight and high-performance Unity Editor tool that allows you to search, filter, and select overlapping GameObjects directly inside complex Scenes and UI Canvases.
Designed to improve workflow efficiency when working with dense hierarchies, layered UI, or crowded 3D environments.

---

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ” Precise GameObject Selection
Quickly pick objects hidden behind others in both 2D/3D World Space and Canvas UI.

### âš¡ High-Performance Architecture
Built with:
- A custom **SimplePool** to prevent unnecessary memory allocations  
- A time-sliced **LazyLoader** to process complex hierarchies without freezing the Editor  

Smooth performance even in large scenes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Filtering System
- Instantly search objects by name
- Extend the search engine using custom filters via the `IFilterable` interface
- Reflection-based auto-detection of custom filters

### ðŸŽ¨ Fully Customizable UI
Fine-tune every visual detail:
- Popup size
- Maximum scanned items
- Background color
- Hover state
- Selected state
- Outline color

All configurable through a dedicated Settings Window.

### ðŸ§© Native Editor Integration
Works seamlessly inside the Unity Scene View as a native popup window â€” no intrusive UI or workflow changes.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Unity Package 
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MirkoRomano/UnityDeepPicker/releases/tag/Release_0.0.1)
2. Download the latest `.unitypackage`
3. Import it into your Unity project

---

## ðŸ–± How to Use
1. Open any Scene in Unity.
2. Hover your mouse over overlapping GameObjects or UI elements.
3. Hold **Alt + Right-Click** in the Scene View.
4. A popup will appear listing all objects directly under your cursor, preserving hierarchy order.
5. Click an item to instantly select and ping it in the Hierarchy.

## í ½í»  Advanced: Custom Filters
One of the most powerful features of Unity Deep Picker is its extensible filtering system.
Deep Picker includes a powerful search bar that allows you to filter picked items similarly to Unityâ€™s built-in Hierarchy search.
Out of the box, you can filter by:

1. **Name** (default search)
2. **Type** (`t:`)
3. **Labels** (`l:`)
4. **Tags** (`tag:`)
5. **Layers** (`lay:`)

But it doesnâ€™t stop there.
By implementing the `IFilterable` interface, your custom filtering logic will be automatically discovered via reflection and seamlessly integrated into the search engine.

### Example: Filter by Tag

If you want to search only for objects with a specific tag using:

```
tag:Player
```

You can implement:

```csharp
using Sparkling.SceneFinder;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class TagFilter : IFilterable
{
    public string FilterKeyword => "tag:"; 
    public int FilterIndex => 0; 

    public bool Evaluate(IFilterContext context)
    {
        return context.SearchFilter.StartsWith(FilterKeyword);
    }

    public IEnumerable<QueryableItem> Filter(IFilterContext context)
    {
        string targetTag = context.FilterWord;
        return context.Objects.Where(item => item.HasTag(targetTag));
    }
}
```

Your filter will automatically become available in the search system.

## ðŸš€ Why This Tool Exists
Working with large Unity scenes can become slow and frustrating, especially when dealing with layered UI Canvases or dense 3D environments.
Unity Deep Picker was built to:

- Provide instant deep-picking functionality  
- Improve hierarchy navigation  
- Reduce friction when selecting overlapping objects  
- Maintain high performance with minimal memory overhead  

---

## ðŸ›  Editor versions
The tool has been tested on the following unity versions:
ãƒ» Unity 2019.4.41f2
ãƒ» Unity 6000.3.0f1
ãƒ» Unity 6000.0.45
